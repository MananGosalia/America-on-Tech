<h2><b>Assignment Title:</b></h2>
<p>Final Data Science Project</p>

<h2><b>Objective:</b></h2>
<p>The objective of this assignment is to combine all of the skills and knowledge gained in this course and complete a <b>data science project</b> from beginning to end.</p>

<hr>

<h2><b>Instructions:</b></h2>
<p>You have just received a letter from your Universityâ€™s Research Experience for Students department that says:</p>
<blockquote>
    "Congratulations! You have been accepted into our Data Science Research Experience Project. We have this research project for you to do: The <b>Student Entrepreneur Project</b> has collected data about students and if they have decided to start a business. Your task is to build a model to predict if a student is likely to start a business based on the features in the dataset. We look forward to hearing back about your progress."
</blockquote>
<p>For this assignment, you will be working with the <b>Student Entrepreneur Dataset</b>, which is available in the file <i>final_project_student_entrepreneur_dataset.csv</i>. The goal of the project is to build a model to predict the outcome (target feature) for the dataset. You will need to work through the entire <b>data science process</b>, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data exploration</li>
    <li>Data visualization</li>
    <li>Data curation</li>
    <li>Feature engineering</li>
    <li>Model training</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Data Exploration and Data Visualization:</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Take the time to complete data exploration on the data, including finding the <b>standard deviation</b> and <b>variance</b> for numerical features. Remember, these should be continuous features.</li>
    <li>Complete all <b>data visualizations</b> to learn about the features.</li>
    <li>Review the <b>distribution</b>, <b>skewness</b>, and <b>shape</b> of the features.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Data Curation:</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Identify any <b>outliers</b>, determine how you will deal with them, and document the method you used for outlier handling.</li>
    <li>Make sure to handle all <b>missing data</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Dummy code</b> all categorical features as discussed during the course.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Feature Engineering:</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Complete any <b>transformations</b> that need to be applied to the data. Examine the data to determine which columns need a <b>log transformation</b>.</li>
    <li>Complete <b>dummy coding</b> for any remaining categorical features.</li>
    <li><b>Optional:</b> Complete <b>Principal Component Analysis</b> (PCA) on the dataset.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Machine Learning Model:</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Build and train a supervised learning model</b>. This can be any supervised learning model, including an ensemble model or deep learning model.</li>
    <li>Review the use cases for <b>supervised learning</b> and <b>unsupervised learning</b> to select the appropriate model for the project.</li>
    <li><b>Describe the evaluation</b> of your model.</li>
    <li>Include the following performance metrics:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Accuracy</b></li>
            <li><b>Precision</b></li>
            <li><b>Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)</b></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
