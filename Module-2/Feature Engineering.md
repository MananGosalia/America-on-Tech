<h2><b>Assignment Title:</b></h2>
<p>Feature Engineering on a Dataset</p>

<h2><b>Objective:</b></h2>
<p>Use multiple <b>feature engineering</b> techniques to clean raw data and ensure that the data is ready for the <b>machine learning</b> process.</p>

<hr>

<h2><b>Instructions:</b></h2>
<p>For this assignment, you will use <b>Jupyter Notebooks</b> and the <b>module7_assignment_dataset.csv</b> dataset. You will need to apply multiple feature engineering techniques to ensure that the data is ready to be used for machine learning.</p>

<h3><b>Feature Engineering Tasks:</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Complete log transformations</b> for the price column to normalize the data.</li>
    <li><b>Complete a value count</b> on the <b>departure_time</b>, <b>class</b>, and <b>airlines</b> columns to understand their distributions.</li>
    <li><b>Complete dummy coding</b> for any categorical data that needs to be transformed into numerical format.</li>
    <li><b>Complete Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</b> on the dataset to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variance.</li>
</ul>
