<h1><b>Data Science Fellowship Assignments</b></h1>

<p>Welcome to the repository for the <b>Data Science Fellowship</b> at <b>America on Tech</b>. This repository contains a series of assignments and projects that were completed as part of the fellowship program. The assignments are designed to help develop and refine skills in data science, including data exploration, visualization, curation, feature engineering, and machine learning.</p>

<hr>

<h2><b>Purpose of this Repository</b></h2>
<p>The goal of this repository is to showcase the various data science techniques and methodologies that were learned and applied throughout the fellowship. The assignments include real-world datasets and are structured to give hands-on experience with key aspects of the data science workflow.</p>

<h2><b>Included Assignments</b></h2>
<p>Each assignment in this repository is tied to a specific aspect of the data science process and includes code, explanations, and visualizations where applicable. Below is an overview of the assignments included in this repository:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Building an Unsupervised Learning Model</b> - Objective: Build a K-Means clustering model to group similar shoppers together using a dataset about shoppersâ€™ demographics and spending behavior.</li>
    <li><b>Feature Engineering on a Dataset</b> - Objective: Apply feature engineering techniques to prepare raw data for machine learning. This includes log transformations, encoding categorical variables, and PCA.</li>
    <li><b>Data Curation and SQL Queries</b> - Objective: Curate and transform data from two CSV datasets. This includes handling missing data, removing outliers, and performing SQL queries to extract useful insights.</li>
    <li><b>Building a Supervised Learning Model</b> - Objective: Develop a supervised learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest) to predict student admission decisions based on various features.</li>
    <li><b>Data Exploration and Data Visualization</b> - Objective: Explore and visualize a dataset on health statistics using various methods such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.</li>
    <li><b>Build an Ensemble Model and Hyperparameterization</b> - Objective: Build a Gradient Boosting model using the XGBoost library, perform hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate model performance.</li>
    <li><b>Final Data Science Project (Student Entrepreneur Dataset)</b> - Objective: Apply all skills learned in the fellowship to build a predictive model using the Student Entrepreneur dataset. This project involves data exploration, curation, feature engineering, and model training.</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>How to Use This Repository</b></h2>
<p>Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific assignment or project. Within each folder, you'll find:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Jupyter Notebooks</b> containing the code and explanations.</li>
    <li><b>Datasets</b> (in .csv format) used for each assignment.</li>
    <li><b>Readme files</b> providing detailed instructions and context for each assignment.</li>
</ul>

<p>To run the code, simply open the Jupyter notebooks, follow the instructions, and execute the cells. You may need to install some libraries, which are listed in the requirements section.</p>

<h2><b>Requirements</b></h2>
<p>Ensure you have the following libraries installed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>pandas</li>
    <li>numpy</li>
    <li>matplotlib</li>
    <li>seaborn</li>
    <li>scikit-learn</li>
    <li>xgboost</li>
    <li>SQLAlchemy</li>
    <li>other necessary libraries depending on the assignments</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>These assignments were a critical part of the Data Science Fellowship at <b>America on Tech</b> and helped to enhance the skills required for real-world data science applications. Feel free to explore the code, replicate the steps, and learn from the examples provided.</p>
